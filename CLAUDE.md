- Once a plan has been implemented or Features implemented, Git commit & push with a brief message of changes (Like a Hook on Stop or SessionEnd of planning and implementation)
- When a change adds or alters a significant module/feature in any directory, create or update a CLAUDE.md in that directory or sub-directory.
- When a directory is tagged/referred in a message, during Read/Explore/Plan phases, check if that directory or any relevant sub-directory contains a CLAUDE.md file. Read and refer to these CLAUDE.md files to gain context about the present working directory (pwd) or tagged directories before proceeding with the task.
- Always prefer WebSearch to fetch the latest official documentation, specs, RFCs, or changelogs related to the technology, framework, library, or API being discussed, rather than relying on outdated or cached knowledge.
